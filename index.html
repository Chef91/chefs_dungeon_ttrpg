                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Chef and I'm the owner of Chef's Dungeon TTRPG. I'm also one of the dungeon masters on our discord server. Being a fan of
                    Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, and Video Games I decided to create this business and community that is built around the
                    things i enjoy in hopes that others will join my community and build friendships.

                <h3>What is Chef's Dungeon?</h3>
                <p>This company was created by our owner/founder "Chef" in 2024 when he started a Professional ttrpg service. The business was running Dungeon & Dragons 5e campaigns and one-shots on a website called <a href="">startplaying.games</a>,
                where he would advertise these games. With growing popularity, he expanded the business to Chef's Dungeon Ttrpg. We offer a lot more than just Dungeons & Dragons with the expansion. Chef wanted to create a community where people could
                not only play Dungeons & Dragons, he wanted a community of people who play <abbr title="table-top roleplayin games">TTRPGs,</abbr> <abbr title="Magic: The Gathering">MTG</abbr> and even our friends in the video gaming community. 
                We have a great staff of game masters and moderators on our server that all have the same goal of creating a great discord community. We also offer competitions & giveaways to our members.</p>

                                of puzzles, exploration, and plenty of combat. He's a big fan of dragons. Come check out some of his adventures!</p>
