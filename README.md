# Chefs_Dungeon
Chef's Dungeon Ttrpg Company is a business that offers various Table-Top Roleplaying Games to an online community. You can find most of our games that we offer on our website.

## Intro

This Repository was built with both a need for a website and a desire to learn more about programming. This project started as "Dev Chef"'s personal project. After some time and growth of the business, Chef decided that this would actually be a live project that customers can use to both help them find out about us, and get situated for their first campaign with us.

## About the Website

This website was built using:
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Framework - Bootstrap</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>PHP</li>
</ul>

This project was built using the languages posted above. As you can see this is a project and the retro design is my creative way of going back to a time that I remember. A time when technology was very new, as I was born in 1991 and can remember learning HTML & CSS with my mom.<br>
This project has a lot of personal meaning to me and it would be greatly appreciated if you don't bash the style but instead appreciate the flashback to the past and enjoy a cool Dungeons & Dragons Website.

### Services Offered

We currently offer:
<ul>
<li>Dungeons & Dragons</li>
<li>Magic: The Gathering</li>
<li>Video Game Lounge</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000</li>
</ul>

## The Codes

Anyone who is reading this repo has access to my files and is welcome to look around in order to get inspired. Please do not directly rip off this entire project as the art is paid for and I've worked very hard to make this website what it is today.
